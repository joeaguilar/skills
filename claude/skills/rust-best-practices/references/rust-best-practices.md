# The comprehensive Rust best practices reference

Idiomatic Rust means working *with* the compiler, not against it. **The single most important principle: start with owned data, borrow in function parameters, and reach for smart pointers or interior mutability only when your design genuinely requires shared or mutable access.** This document covers ownership, error handling, API design, performance, concurrency, testing, and tooling — synthesized from the Rust API Guidelines, the Rust Performance Book, Effective Rust, the Rust Design Patterns book, and guidance from prominent Rust developers including BurntSushi, matklad, Alice Ryhl, and dtolnay. Each section provides actionable rules and concrete code, not abstract theory.

## Ownership, borrowing, and the mental model that stops the fights

The borrow checker enforces a simple invariant: at any point, data has either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references, never both. Most "fights" with the borrow checker stem from mixing ownership and borrowing in ways that create conflicting access. The fix is almost always a design change, not a workaround.

**The core heuristic is: move data when you need to store it, borrow when you only need to read or temporarily modify it.** Structs should own their data (`String`, `Vec<T>`, `PathBuf`). Function parameters should borrow (`&str`, `&[T]`, `&Path`). This separation eliminates most lifetime annotations entirely.

Always prefer the borrowed type over borrowing the owned type in function signatures — accept `&str` not `&String`, `&[T]` not `&Vec<T>`. These more general types accept both owned and borrowed data via Deref coercion, making your APIs more flexible at zero cost.

**When to clone vs borrow.** Clone is acceptable when data is small with negligible performance impact, when crossing thread boundaries, when the alternative is complex lifetime annotations that hurt readability, or during prototyping. Clone is a code smell when it appears in hot loops on large data, when it exists solely to silence the borrow checker without understanding why, or when `Rc`/`Arc` would better express the actual ownership relationship. As matklad (rust-analyzer author) observed: "I've walked into codebases with lifetimes everywhere and codebases with clones everywhere. The clone code is always easier to work with."

**`Cow<'a, T>` is underused.** For CLI tools and agent systems processing data that often passes through unmodified, `Cow` defers allocation until mutation is actually needed. A function returning `Cow<'_, str>` borrows when it can and allocates only when it must — perfect for normalization, path processing, and template expansion.

### Working with the borrow checker, not against it

The most common borrow checker patterns and their solutions form a small, learnable set:

**Split borrows on structs** work automatically — you can mutably borrow `app.database` while immutably borrowing `app.config` because the compiler understands disjoint field access. But methods taking `&mut self` borrow the entire struct. The fix: restructure to pass individual fields as parameters, or destructure the struct with `let App { ref mut database, ref config, .. } = app`.

**The temporary variable trick** resolves most expression-level conflicts. When `foo.field = foo.compute()` fails, extract the computation: `let val = foo.compute(); foo.field = val;`. The immutable borrow ends before the mutation begins.

**The Entry API** eliminates the classic HashMap double-borrow: `*map.entry(key).or_insert(0) += 1` replaces the get-then-insert pattern that creates conflicting borrows.

**`mem::take` and `mem::replace`** solve the "move out of `&mut`" problem. When you need to take ownership of data inside an enum variant through a mutable reference, `mem::take(field)` swaps it with the default value — essential for state machine transitions.

**Interior mutability (`RefCell`, `Cell`, `Mutex`) is a design tool, not a default.** Reach for it when trait constraints require `&self` but you need mutation (caching, counters), not as a general escape hatch from the borrow checker. The anti-pattern is wrapping everything in `Rc<RefCell<T>>` — this defers all checks to runtime and hides the actual ownership design. As one Rust community guide puts it: "A borrow-checker issue may be a code smell or a real bug. Investigate fixing it with better design before throwing mutability wrappers on it."

### Lifetimes: the rules that eliminate most annotations

The compiler applies three elision rules automatically: each input reference gets a distinct lifetime, a single input lifetime propagates to all outputs, and `&self`/`&mut self` lifetime propagates to outputs. This means **explicit lifetime annotations are only needed when multiple input references exist and the output borrows from one of them**, or when structs contain references.

The critical anti-pattern from pretzelhammer's "Common Rust Lifetime Misconceptions": never tie `&'a mut self` to the struct's lifetime parameter. Writing `fn method(&'a mut self)` on `struct Foo<'a>` permanently borrows the struct after one call. Let elision give self its own shorter lifetime with just `fn method(&mut self)`.

For CLI tools and agent systems, the practical guideline is straightforward: **default to owned types in structs, use lifetimes only for zero-copy parsing or when performance profiling demands it.** Messages crossing boundaries between agents should own their data. Shared immutable configuration belongs behind `Arc<T>`.

## Error handling that scales from prototype to production

Error handling in Rust operates on a clear principle articulated by BurntSushi: "If a Rust program panics, it signals a bug. Correct Rust programs don't panic." This means `unwrap()` is reserved for invariants you can prove, while `?` is the standard mechanism for propagating expected failures.

**`unwrap()` is acceptable** when failure genuinely indicates a programmer error — parsing a hardcoded constant like `"127.0.0.1".parse::<IpAddr>().unwrap()`, accessing an index you just validated, or in tests where panic-as-failure is the design. **`unwrap()` is dangerous** on any I/O operation, network call, user input, or in library code where panics steal error-handling control from callers. Always prefer `expect("reason")` over `unwrap()` in production code — the message documents the invariant and aids debugging.

### `thiserror` vs `anyhow`: they complement, not compete

The canonical guidance from dtolnay (author of both crates): **use `thiserror` for libraries and modules where callers need to match on specific error variants; use `anyhow` for application-level code where errors are displayed or logged, not matched.** For a CLI tool or agent system, this means `anyhow::Result` in `main()`, CLI dispatch, and orchestration layers, with `thiserror`-derived enums in reusable internal modules.

```rust
// thiserror for domain errors callers need to handle
#[derive(thiserror::Error, Debug)]
pub enum PipelineError {
    #[error("Failed to fetch from {url}")]
    FetchFailed { url: String, #[source] source: reqwest::Error },
    #[error("Validation: {0}")]
    Validation(String),
}

// anyhow at the application boundary
fn main() -> ExitCode {
    match run() {
        Ok(()) => ExitCode::SUCCESS,
        Err(e) => { eprintln!("Error: {e:#}"); ExitCode::from(1) }
    }
}
fn run() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let config = load_config().context("loading configuration")?;
    execute(config)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

BurntSushi's nuance: for libraries intended for broad use, he suggests writing concrete error types by hand to avoid proc-macro dependencies. Alex Fedoseev moved away from `anyhow` entirely in complex pipelines because finding and updating context strings across deep call stacks became harder than maintaining explicit types.

**Error context discipline matters.** Each error level should describe only what happened at its level — don't embed the cause's message in your Display implementation. Use `.context()` or `#[source]` to create proper chains. In async code, add context aggressively because async stack traces are far less helpful than sync ones.

**Handling errors in `main()`.** The cleanest pattern separates concerns: `main()` returns `ExitCode` and handles display, while a `run()` function returns `anyhow::Result<()>` and uses `?` throughout. Avoid `process::exit()` — it doesn't run destructors. BurntSushi's ripgrep pattern (`if let Err(err) = try_main() { eprintln!("{:#}", err); process::exit(1); }`) remains widely used.

### The pragmatism spectrum

| Phase | Error handling | Types | Borrowing |
|-------|---------------|-------|-----------|
| **Prototype** | `unwrap()`/`expect()` everywhere | `String` in structs | `clone()` freely |
| **Correct** | `?` with `.context()`, custom errors | Newtypes for validated data | Borrow in parameters |
| **Optimized** | Same as Correct | `Cow<str>` where profiling shows benefit | Lifetimes only where profiling demands |

This "make it work, make it right, make it fast" approach is explicitly endorsed by thoughtbot and aligns with the Rust Design Patterns book, which lists "clone to satisfy the borrow checker" as an anti-pattern but acknowledges it's fine in prototyping and non-performance-critical code.

**`unsafe` in CLI tools and agent systems: you almost never need it.** The standard library and ecosystem crates handle unsafe internals. When it is necessary (FFI being the main case), minimize scope, encapsulate in safe APIs, document invariants with `// SAFETY:` comments, and test with Miri. Every `unsafe` block should be a conscious, documented decision.

## API design that makes misuse a compile error

The Rust API Guidelines establish conventions that the standard library and major crates follow. The most impactful patterns go beyond naming conventions into type-driven design that prevents entire categories of bugs at compile time.

**Naming conventions** follow RFC 430: `CamelCase` for types/traits, `snake_case` for functions/methods/modules, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants. Conversion methods use `as_` (cheap, borrowed→borrowed), `to_` (expensive or borrowed→owned), `into_` (owned→owned, consuming). Getters are just `field_name()`, not `get_field_name()`.

**The newtype pattern** is a zero-cost abstraction that prevents type confusion: `Email(String)`, `UserId(u64)`, `Port(u16)`. The private inner field forces construction through a validating constructor, making the "parse, don't validate" principle concrete. Instead of validating a raw string and hoping it stays valid, parse it into a `ValidatedEmail` type — downstream code that accepts `ValidatedEmail` can't receive unvalidated input. This pattern also works around the orphan rule by wrapping foreign types.

**The builder pattern** is essential in Rust since the language has no keyword arguments or default parameter values. Builder methods take `mut self` by value (preventing reuse after `build()`), use `impl Into<String>` for string-like parameters, and the final `build()` returns `Result` to validate required fields. The `typed-builder` crate generates this boilerplate via derive macro.

**The typestate pattern** encodes state machines in the type system. Methods consume `self` and return a new type representing the next state — calling `.send_command()` on an unauthenticated client simply doesn't compile. This is powerful for connection lifecycles, protocol implementations, and agent initialization sequences, though it increases generics complexity.

**Accept broad, return specific.** Function parameters should use `impl AsRef<Path>`, `impl Into<String>`, `impl IntoIterator<Item = T>` to accept the widest useful range of inputs. Return types should be concrete or `impl Trait` — callers get maximum information. To control monomorphization bloat, keep the generic entry function thin and delegate to a non-generic inner function.

### Trait design: open vs closed, static vs dynamic

The central decision in Rust polymorphism is **traits vs enums** — open vs closed sets. Enums are right for CLI subcommands, message types, and internal state machines where all variants are known at compile time. Traits are right for plugin systems, user-defined backends, and agent tool registries where external code must add implementations.

**Generics (`<T: Trait>`) give zero-cost static dispatch** through monomorphization — the compiler generates specialized code for each concrete type. **Trait objects (`dyn Trait`) give dynamic dispatch** through vtable indirection but produce a single compiled version. For hot paths, prefer generics. For plugin architectures and heterogeneous collections, use `Box<dyn Trait>` or `Arc<dyn Trait + Send + Sync>`.

Key trait patterns every Rust developer should know: **extension traits** add methods to foreign types via blanket implementations (convention: `FooExt`). **Sealed traits** prevent external implementations for future-proofing. **Marker traits** signal capabilities without methods (`Send`, `Sync`, custom `Idempotent`). Use **associated types** when there's exactly one natural implementation per type (`Iterator::Item`), and **generic parameters** when multiple implementations make sense (`From<T>`).

**Derive standard traits eagerly.** `Debug` on every public type (required by API guidelines). `Clone`, `PartialEq`, `Eq`, `Hash` when semantically meaningful. `Default` when a zero/empty value exists. `Serialize`/`Deserialize` behind a `serde` feature flag. Never add trait bounds to struct definitions that are only needed by derives — the generated `impl` blocks add their own bounds.

## Performance, memory, and the art of not optimizing prematurely

The Rust Performance Book establishes the foundational rule: **"It is only worth optimizing hot code."** Rust's baseline performance from ownership semantics, zero-cost iterators, and no garbage collector means idiomatic code is already fast. The biggest wins come from algorithm and data structure changes, not micro-optimizations.

**Zero-cost abstractions that are genuinely zero-cost:** iterator chains (`.filter().map().collect()` compiles to the same assembly as hand-written loops — benchmarks confirm identical or better performance due to loop unrolling), closures (statically dispatched and inlined), generics via monomorphization, and `Option<&T>` (pointer-sized via niche optimization). **Not zero-cost:** `dyn Trait` (vtable indirection), `Box<dyn Trait>` (heap allocation plus dynamic dispatch).

**Collection choice matters more than micro-optimization.** `Vec` is the default — contiguous, cache-friendly, and right 90% of the time. Use `with_capacity()` when size is known. `HashMap` with `with_capacity()` for key-value lookups. `BTreeMap` for ordered keys or range queries. `VecDeque` for double-ended access. `LinkedList` almost never — poor cache locality. `SmallVec<[T; N]>` for many short-lived vectors that usually fit in N elements, but always benchmark — the branch overhead per operation means it doesn't always win.

**Allocation reduction strategies** from the Performance Book: reuse collections by declaring them outside loops and calling `.clear()`, use `clone_from()` over `clone()` to reuse existing buffers, prefer `&str` parameters over `String`, avoid `format!()` when a literal suffices, and profile allocation sites with `dhat-rs`. For release builds, enable **LTO** (`lto = "thin"` or `"fat"`), set `codegen-units = 1`, and consider alternative allocators like `jemalloc` or `mimalloc` which can provide substantial improvements.

### Memory management: stack, heap, and smart pointers

**Stack** for small, known-size, short-lived data (essentially free allocation). **Heap** via `Box` for recursive types, large data, trait objects, and data outliving the current scope. `Box<T>` is the simplest heap pointer — single owner, zero-cost dereferencing.

| Smart pointer | When to use |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Box<T>` | Single owner, heap allocation needed (recursive types, large data, trait objects) |
| `Rc<T>` | Shared ownership, single-threaded (graph structures, shared config) |
| `Arc<T>` | Shared ownership, multi-threaded (shared state across tokio tasks) |
| `Cow<'a, T>` | Mixed borrowed/owned, defer allocation until mutation needed |
| `Weak<T>` | Break reference cycles in Rc/Arc graphs (parent-child relationships) |

**`Rc`/`Arc` architecture guidance** from matklad: "There are usually a couple of Arcs and Mutexes at the top level which are the linchpin of the whole architecture — like rust-analyzer is basically an `Arc<RwLock<GlobalState>>` plus cancellation. But throwing Arcs and interior mutability everywhere makes it harder to notice these central pieces." Prefer `Arc<MyStruct>` over a struct where every field is individually `Arc`-wrapped.

Interior mutability follows a clear decision tree: `Cell<T>` for single-threaded `Copy` types, `RefCell<T>` for single-threaded non-`Copy`, `Mutex<T>` for multi-threaded write-heavy access, `RwLock<T>` for multi-threaded read-heavy access, and atomics for simple counters and flags. Never layer `Cell`/`RefCell` inside `Mutex`/`RwLock` — they already provide interior mutability.

## Concurrency patterns for async agent systems

The fundamental constraint: `tokio::spawn` requires `Send + 'static`. This means spawned futures and everything they capture must be transferable between threads — so `Rc<RefCell<T>>` won't compile in async tasks (use `Arc<Mutex<T>>`), and borrowed data must be owned or `Arc`-wrapped.

**The #1 async rule** from Alice Ryhl: "Async code should never spend a long time without reaching an `.await`." The threshold is roughly **10–100 microseconds between await points**. CPU-heavy work belongs in `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` or Rayon, not in async tasks where it starves the runtime.

### The actor pattern for agent systems

Alice Ryhl's actor pattern is the recommended architecture for agent systems. It separates the Actor (a spawned task with a message loop) from the Handle (a cloneable communication interface):

```rust
struct Agent { receiver: mpsc::Receiver<Msg>, state: State }
#[derive(Clone)]
struct AgentHandle { sender: mpsc::Sender<Msg> }

impl AgentHandle {
    fn new() -> Self {
        let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel(32); // bounded for backpressure
        tokio::spawn(async move {
            let mut agent = Agent { receiver: rx, state: State::new() };
            while let Some(msg) = agent.receiver.recv().await {
                agent.handle(msg);
            }
        });
        Self { sender: tx }
    }
}
```

The agent shuts down when all handles are dropped (channel returns `None`). Use `oneshot` channels for request-response patterns and `watch` channels for propagating configuration changes.

### Avoiding the common pitfalls

**Holding locks across `.await`** is the most frequent async mistake. Release the lock before awaiting: `{ let data = mutex.lock().await.clone(); } do_something(data).await;`. Use `std::sync::Mutex` (not `tokio::sync::Mutex`) when the critical section is short and doesn't cross an await — it's faster.

**Cancellation safety** is subtle: `tokio::select!` cancels unselected branches mid-execution. Ensure operations are safe to cancel or use cancellation-safe alternatives. Carl Lerche identifies this as "the biggest pitfall" in async Rust.

**Channel selection:** `mpsc` for actor inboxes and task coordination, `oneshot` for request-response and bridging Rayon↔tokio, `broadcast` for pub-sub event broadcasting, `watch` for latest-value state propagation. Always use **bounded channels** — unbounded queues will exhaust memory under load.

**When async isn't needed:** many CLI tools work perfectly with synchronous code plus Rayon for data parallelism. Use async only for significant concurrent I/O (HTTP, network agents). As corrode.dev advises: "Learn how to write good synchronous Rust first."

## Code organization, testing, and the tooling that enforces quality

### Module and crate structure

Keep `main.rs` thin — orchestration only, delegate to `lib.rs`. Group by domain/feature rather than by kind (avoid the `models/`/`services/`/`utils/` anti-pattern). Use `pub(crate)` liberally for internal helpers shared across modules. Re-export key types at the crate root with `pub use` so users get `my_crate::Config` without knowing the internal module path.

Split into separate crates when independent compilation speeds up builds, when you need enforced API boundaries, or when different parts have different dependency trees. For CLI tools, the common pattern is a workspace with a thin binary crate, a core logic library, and optionally a CLI-parsing crate. But Tokio's experience suggests **feature flags often provide sufficient modularity without multi-crate overhead** — consider features before splitting.

Workspace `Cargo.toml` should use `[workspace.dependencies]` for centralized version management and `resolver = "2"` for correct feature resolution. Feature flags must be **additive** — enabling a feature should never remove functionality.

### Testing that catches real bugs

Unit tests live in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` inside each source file and can access private items. Integration tests in `tests/` test only the public API. **Doctests serve double duty as documentation and tests** — every public function should have a working example in its doc comment.

**Property-based testing with `proptest`** catches edge cases that example-based tests miss. Use it for serialization roundtrips, parser correctness, algorithm invariants, and any function with a broad input space. The `proptest!` macro generates random inputs and automatically shrinks failures to minimal reproducing cases.

**Snapshot testing with `insta`** is invaluable for CLI tools. It captures command output, serialization results, and complex data structures as committed snapshots, with `cargo insta review` providing an interactive TUI for approving changes. The `insta-cmd` integration tests full CLI invocations including exit codes and stderr.

**For async testing**, `#[tokio::test]` works as a drop-in. Use `tokio::time::pause()` to make time-dependent tests deterministic and instant. For HTTP dependencies, `wiremock` provides async-native mock servers. Prefer **dependency injection** (trait objects or generics) over mocking frameworks when possible — it makes code naturally testable.

### Clippy configuration that catches bugs without noise

The modern approach uses `[lints.clippy]` in `Cargo.toml` (stable since Rust 1.74). Enable `all` and `pedantic` at warn level with `priority = -1`, then selectively allow the noisy pedantic lints. Cherry-pick valuable restriction lints individually.

```toml
[lints.clippy]
all = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
pedantic = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
# Restriction lints worth enabling for production code
unwrap_used = "warn"
dbg_macro = "deny"
print_stdout = "warn"
todo = "warn"
# Pedantic lints that generate too much noise
module_name_repetitions = "allow"
must_use_candidate = "allow"
```

**Use `#[expect(lint)]` instead of `#[allow(lint)]`** for local suppressions (stable since Rust 1.81). The `expect` attribute warns when the suppression becomes unnecessary — `allow` silently accumulates dead suppressions forever. Always include a `reason`: `#[expect(clippy::unwrap_used, reason = "validated at startup")]`.

### The CI pipeline that enforces everything

The essential CI jobs, in order: `cargo fmt --check` (fastest, catches formatting), `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` (catches code quality issues), `cargo test --workspace` (correctness), and `cargo deny check` (license, advisory, and dependency policy). Use `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` for **50–80% build time reduction**, `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` for toolchain setup, and `cargo-nextest` for faster parallel test execution.

Additional tools that pay for themselves: `cargo-audit` for security vulnerability scanning against the RustSec database, `cargo-msrv` for MSRV verification, `cargo-semver-checks` for detecting semver violations before publish, `cargo-udeps` for finding unused dependencies, and `cargo-hack` for testing all feature flag combinations. For profiling, `cargo flamegraph` and `dhat-rs` identify hot paths and allocation sites respectively.

## Conclusion

The throughline across every section of this reference is a single design philosophy: **let the type system and ownership model do the work.** Parse don't validate. Own data in structs, borrow in functions. Use `?` not `unwrap()`. Encode states in types. Accept broad, return specific. Make illegal states unrepresentable.

The practical counterbalance is equally important: clone freely during prototyping, reach for `anyhow` before building custom error hierarchies, skip lifetimes until profiling justifies them, and use async only when I/O concurrency demands it. Rust rewards incrementally increasing rigor — start with working code that the compiler accepts, then tighten types and reduce allocations where measurements show it matters.

The developer who internalizes these patterns stops fighting the borrow checker not because they memorized rules, but because their default design choices — owned data, borrowed parameters, bounded channels, typed states — naturally align with what the compiler enforces. The compiler becomes a collaborator that catches real bugs, not an obstacle to productivity.
